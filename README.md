- Hi, I’m Caleb!
- I’m interested in data analysis, fintech, and database applications.
- I’m currently learning data analysis with excel, python, SQL, and Tableau (not necessarily in that order).
- I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything! I want to learn as much as I can!
- How to reach me: by email at cgunn9@liberty.edu
